FileManager is a web-based file browser that can easily be integrated with popular inline HTML editors. Out of the box, 
FileManager works with FCKEditor and its successor, CKEditor. FileManager allows you to upload, download, rename, and 
delete files and folders on the web serverâ€™s hard drive, providing crucial functionality for content management systems, 
blogs, and other web-publishing software. FileManager includes server-side connectors for Lasso and Python, and can be 
extended to support additional languages via a simple JavaScript API.
